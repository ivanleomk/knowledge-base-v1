# Data Structures

## Terminology

1. Data : Information
2. Computation: Data processing
3. Algorithm : The sequence of computational steps that transofmr the input data ( given ) into the output data ( wanted )
4. Data Structures : An ordering of data which allow for certain results

## Main Goals

1. Algorithm Correctness : Does my algorithm do what it's supposed to do?
2. Algorithm Termination : Does my algorithm always complete its work
3. Termination

- Worst Case
- Average Case
- Best Worst Case
